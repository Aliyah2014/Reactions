# Introduction

reactions is a react based (pun-intended) drag and drop mood board where users add their own pictures or download royalty free pictures from sites like unsplash.com and use them to create personalised mood pin boards by dragging the pictures to the desired board and then add useful notes and widgets.

# Why we need this

as creative individuals, we want to use pictures to create a mood board that will inspire and motivate us to be creative and productive. where we can also engage and reflect on tasks ahead and memories in the past.

# Our Workflow

we started by creating this github repository and deploying it to netlify. From there we set up react.js and created a file structure that we could easily write to. we then collaborated using live share in visual studio implement the styles and functionalities from apis into our project.


# Future Development
